# ML-project
Welcome to my ML project on diabetes
I have created a SVM(Support Vector Machine) and Random Forest Model on Diabetes Dataset.
Using these one can predict whether a person is suffering from Diabetes or not after inputting certain parameters like Pregnancies, Glucose,	BloodPressure,	SkinThickness,	Insulin,	BMI,	DiabetesPedigreeFunction,	Age
It also signifies what features are most important in our given parameters.
